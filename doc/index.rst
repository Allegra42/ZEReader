Welcome to the ZEReader documentation!
===============================================

ZEReader is an open source hardware and software E-Book Reader platform.
Originally developed as a bachelor's thesis in electrical engineering,
the project now evolves as a hobby initiative dedicated to further develop
this hackable and customizable platform.

.. attention::

   The ZEReader firmware and the corresponding hardware project are still in a
   pretty early stage and not yet ready for productive use.
